Using the R programming language, various classification algorithms are implemented on a zipcode and home equity loan data sets.

1. Apply the Na√Øve Bayes, LDA, and Multiple Logistic Regression to the Zip code data using only digits 2, 3, and 5. Compare the testing error.
2. Apply the kNN method to the entire data set of the Home Equity Loan data. Find the best value of k using the cross validation error.
3. Split randomly the Home Equity Loan data into 3 parts (50% training, 25% validating, and 25% testing). Repeat this 3 times and compare the training, validating, and testing error of (i) the logistic regression model, (ii) LDA, and (iii) the tree model. Compare the results.
